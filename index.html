            <h2>Who We Are</h2>
            <p> What started off as an account made by two buddies who love the NHL's Ottawa Senators, has turned into the #1 source for Ottawa Senators news on Youtube. </p>

              <p>During the early years of SENS TALK, Co-Founder and current host of the show, Brandon Plant, would upload short news update clips onto Youtube. However, as time went on Brandon begun to expand the horizons of the channel, by uploading pre and post game report videos for every single Ottawa Senators game onto the SENS TALK Youtube channel. This was the most important move in the channel's history, as SENS TALK is singlehandely known for it's post game break downs to this day.   </p>
              <h2>Where We Are Headed</h2>
              <p>The future of SENS TALK is full of potential. Our host, Brandon Plant, has repeatedly mentioned how he'd want to expand into online gambling and more live content. The rest of the employees at SENS TALK would agree, including Vice President Noah Luden.</p>
              <p>Why is the future of our channel live content and online gambling? Well here's three reasons why: </p>
              <ol class="list">
                <li>Sports betting has just been legalized, and is a multi-billion dollar industry. It is the way of the future for sports media, and if SENS TALK wants to stay relevant we must get involved in the industry. </li>
                <li>Live content is crucial in creating more engagement with our online content, and it allows the hosts to interact with the fans.</li>
                <li>Reaction videos are some of the most viral on the Youtube platform, so we will be taking advantage of that by live streaming our live reactions to the games.</li>
